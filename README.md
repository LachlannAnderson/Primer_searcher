# Primer_searcher
Coding module to allow search of an ncbi sequence for a specific primer sequence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This programme runs without installation of specific data.

The user will be prompted to input an accession number of their sequence of interest, as well as their primer sequence, and an email address to be associated with the search. (Example accession numbers and primer codes have been provided to allow testing of the code.)

The programme will then access the ncbi database in order to extract the sequence of interest and organism name, if available.

The code will then produce a list of the positions of each instance of the primer in the sequence as well as a count of the occurances.

If designing primers it may be beneficial to choose a sequence which only occurs at your specific section to prevent background noise in your results.
